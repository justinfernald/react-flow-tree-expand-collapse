# React Flow Expand and Collapse Reimplementation

This is a reimplementation of the [Expand and Collapse example](https://reactflow.dev/examples/layout/expand-collapse) from ReactFlow

This example is created in a way so that is very simple to customize. It does use MobX for state management and Emotion for styling.

Thank you React Flow for creating an awesome library

Not all the features from the original example are reimplemented like animation and the ability to click and add new nodes just the core concept of toggling the viewing of children.
